I worked on this challenge by myself.
 
// For each mission, write the title as a comment. (Shown here). Also include pseudocode as a comment. 
// Note: to make commenting easier, you can highlight the section you want to comment and hold 
// command + / This will comment the line. 
// Rescue Mission

// Reflection:
What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
o	 “this.” Refers to the object that you are commanding. So in our case it was the Thorin the soldier.
•	What does the () do in JavaScript?
o	 The parenthesis hold the value of the command. So if the comman was “this.moveXY(45,50)” the numbers in the parenthesis are where our object would move to.
•	What is the point of the semicolons?
o 	Separates commands

I accidently created a new my_solution.js page before seeing this so I deleted my pseudo code and replaced it with my real code as I did the challenge.
