# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://mulv3959.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
    
    Ya I had a lot of fun. It is cool to think of a design and then actually create it just using a computer. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
    
    I thought about what I think a good design would be. Then made a wireframe. And then attempted to code it. Coding went fairly well for the most part but I really struggle at positioning the different sections of the site. So that took the majority of the time.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
   
    I would just change around the positions a little bit. And then hopefully add some more content and cool features. Yes it was difficult. It would be very helpful if I could better understand how to position different items in my site. If I could do that, everything would be much easier. And I could focus more on adding other cool features to my site.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
