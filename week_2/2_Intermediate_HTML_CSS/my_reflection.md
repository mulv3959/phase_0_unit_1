# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

    I like them a lot, will make it a lot easier. However, I have to remember implicit and explicit sections and how they work together. I do not really understand it fully now but I know the header numbers have to work together in some way. 
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
    
    I did not understand this at all!
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

    I use google chrome. Yes I have noticed that and I do not like it. I think familiarity is a big factor in whether or not people like websites.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
