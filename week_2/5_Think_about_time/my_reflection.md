# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

    My biggest time management challenge is that I am a procrastinator. I always have been but I have so much going on now that procrastination is not an option.
* How will you combat that? 

    I will combat that by continually reminding myself I need to stay on top of my work. I wrote notes both on my phone and computer reminding me that I always have something to do. 
* What techniques will you try?

    I will try the technique I explained above along with every Sunday I am going to write out a schedule for the week to make sure I can fit in Phase 0, academics, and athletics. 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	  My plan is described above.
